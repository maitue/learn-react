For more information,\n *          see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html\">Replication</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 Developer Guide</i>. </p>\n *          <note>\n *             <p>To perform this operation, the user or role performing the operation must have the\n *                <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html\">iam:PassRole</a> permission.</p>\n *          </note>\n *          <p>Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication\n *          configuration, you provide the name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want\n *          Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your\n *          behalf, and other relevant information.</p>\n *\n *\n *          <p>A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of\n *          1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in\n *          the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for\n *          each subset.</p>\n *\n *          <p>To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to,\n *          add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an\n *          object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the\n *          configuration, you must also add the following elements:\n *             <code>DeleteMarkerReplication</code>, <code>Status</code>, and\n *          <code>Priority</code>.</p>\n *          <note>\n *             <p>If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles\n *             replication of delete markers differently.

The resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the\n *          operation.

To replicate AWS KMS-encrypted objects, add the\n *          following: <code>SourceSelectionCriteria</code>, <code>SseKmsEncryptedObjects</code>,\n *             <code>Status</code>, <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code>, and\n *             <code>ReplicaKmsKeyID</code>.
